Bootstrap Requirements
	- Bootstrap navbar: My website includes a navbar, with the sections "Education", "Interests", and "Involvement"
	- My website uses the Bootstrap grid system primarily in the involvement section, where I gave the images on the left the class "col-sm-4" and the texts on the right the class "col-sm-8"

Javascript Requirements
	- Onclick handler: I added a handler that adds a border around the first image on the page when the user clicks on my name in the top left corner. I also added an onclick handler that gets rid of this border when the user clicks on the same image.

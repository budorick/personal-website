# personal-website

HTML requirements:
  1. links: I linked to the various websites of the programs in which I am involved, and to link to my email and social media.
     divs: I used divs to divide my header and footer from the rest of my code, separate my different sections, and separate different parts within one of my sections.
     paragraphs: I used paragraphs to include certain text in my site.
     images: I used an image near the top of my site, 3 images of my dog, images to represent programs in which I am involved, and to represent my email and social media. 
     
  2. title: In the head, I used a title tag to name my website "Abby Budorick".
     SEO meta tags: In the head, I used meta tags to declare myself the author, include a description of my site, and include keywords to allow search engines to find my website more easily ("Abby Budorick", "USC", etc.).
     
CSS requirements:
  1. I linked to a separate style sheet (entitled "website-style.css").
  
  2. border-radius: I used this to create a border with rounded-corners around my social media icons when they are hovered over.
     background-color: I used this to change the background color of my header to a dark grey, the background color of my site to a light purple-ish color, and the background of my sections to white.
     padding: I used this to add extra space to the top and bottom of each of my sections, to add extra space in between each of my activities, and to slightly move my social media icons when hovered over.
     
  3. I used the google font "Raleway" by including the link provided by google fonts in my head, then changing the font of all elements in my CSS stylesheet.
  
  4. I used a hover keyframe animation to enlarge the photos of my dog when the mouse hovers over them, and to add a border around and slightly move my social media icons when hovered over.
